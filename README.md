# GrocerySQL
(Project dated April 2020)
This project was to learn how to set up and manage a grocery store database within MySQL and establish a connection to a text editor (Sublime).
The project then can be used with a virtual environment set up in Terminal to run a Flask server that displays the SQL datatbase content.
It allows me to see and connect through a 3 tier application (UI, Backend, Database). Further personalization could be used to design a web app but would be too 
time consuming for a class project.
